## Current Project: Making a script to automate wim extraction and setup

**Problem to solve:** I need to recreate Windows images every quarter for
security and PCI compliance reasons. My current solution to this was to mount my
existing `install.wim` and boot it into audit mode, make whatever changes are
needed, and reapply any sysprep stuff, and recapture. This became very tedious
very fast with most of the steps being done manually.

**Goal:** I want to create a nice script to do most of the step for me. I will out line it first with my rough order and where I think the commands need to go for this process. Then I will slowly go through and actually uncomment the commands and make the thing real!

**Outline so far:**

```powershell
# ALL VARS

$IsoLocation = 'C:\VM\regbaseimages\SW_DVD9_WIN_ENT_LTSC_2021_64BIT_English_MLF_X22-84414.ISO'
#'C:\iso\WinLTSCImage.iso'

# Mount iso file
    # $firstDriveLetter = (("E".."Z" | Where-Object {((Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem).Name) -NotContains $_})[0])+":\"    
    $var = (Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath $IsoLocation -PassThru | Get-Volume | Get-DiskImage).DevicePath    

# Copy install.wim from sources directory
    # Copy-Item

# Unmount iso file
    Dismount-DiskImage -DevicePath $var
    #(Get-Volume | Get-DiskImage).DevicePath

# Remove unneeded images from install.wim
    # Remove-WindowsImage -ImagePath <PATH TO IMAGE> -Index <1, 2, etc.> -CheckIntegrity
    # Do some fancy lookups here for finding only Enterprise LTSC version

# Rename the wim index to our own thing
    # Using dism run below
    # Imagex /info "<PATH TO IMAGE>" <Index Number> "<NEW IMAGE NAME>" "<NEW IMAGE DESCRIPTION>"

# Mount wim file
    # Mount-WindowsImage -imagepath "<PATH TO IMAGE>" -index 1 -path "<PATH TO MOUNT FOLDER>"

# Inject device drivers
    # dism /Image:<PATH TO MOUNT FOLDER> /Add-Driver /Driver:<PATH TO DRIVER FOLDER> /Recurse

# Make Audit Mode answer file
    # To configure Windows to boot to audit mode, add the Microsoft-Windows-Deployment | Reseal | Mode = audit
    # Run script on first time start up

# Copy sysprep files into sysprep folder in image
    # Copy-Item

# Unmount wim file
    # Dismount-WindowsImage -path "<PATH TO MOUNT FOLDER>" -save

# Rename wim file
    # Rename-File -Path <path to install.wim> -NewName <New Name of wim>

# Hyper-V automated setup
    # Build Virtual Machine
    # ? Mount VHD 
    # ? Run Diskpart commands to format the drive correctly
    # ? Expand-WindowsImage and <cmd.exe /c "bcdboot W:\Windows /s S: /f ALL"> to apply wim to vhd drive
    # ? Unmount vhd drive
    # ? Assign vhd to Virtual Machine
    # ? Start Virtual Machine

# Boot Virtual Machine
    # Audit Mode boots automatically and runs Startup script

# In startup Script
    # Check for windows updates - Install Windows update module from PSGallery
    # Reconfigure sysprep folder for actual install - New answer file, etc.
    # ? Other Stuff?
    # ? Disk clean up, remove old windows installs, etc.
    # ? Figure out a way to get through multiple reboot automatically for updates
    # Shutdown Image with generalize and sysprep ready to go

# Capture VHD to wim
    # might need to do some fancy winpe stuff

# Test booting the image to verify successful configuration
    # Verify sysprep processes correctly
    # Verify start up scripts process correctly

# Clean up
    # ? Maybe remove all Hyper-V stuff
    # If using WDS, copy new image to WDS
```
