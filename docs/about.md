# About Me

My name is Hayden Haslam.

I am a Retail System Engineer for Maverik Inc.

I have primarily been tasked with building and managing various aspects of my
companies retail Windows images.

This personal website will be use to help me manage and organize most of the
things I have learned along the way.

I started this job with very little PowerShell experience, but immediately
latched onto the power of PowerShell to help me accomplish most of my automation
and building.

Hopefully this could benefit someone down the road someday, although it will
most likely be myself when I forget how I did something in the past.

Please feel free to reach out to me about anything you see here. Feedback,
Criticism, Encouragement, etc. All is Welcome :)
